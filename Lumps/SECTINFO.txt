// This is a special lump designed to work with Team Based games, like Domination.
//  We're going to use this lump specifically for the Domination game mode [ http://wiki.zandronum.com/Game_Modes#Domination ]
//  Specific formatting:
//          Zandronum: http://wiki.zandronum.com/SECTINFO
//          ZDoom: http://zdoom.org/wiki/SECTINFO
//  The map formatting looks - strange, but our main focus is primarily the Points property - which provides the main functionality for the Domination
//      game mode, and the Names property - which is specifically for the Chat_Substitution CVar [ http://zdoom.org/wiki/Skulltag_features#Console_variables ].
//
// Keep in mind that we're not using Sector Reference's tag, instead we're using their references ID.
//  For example: Points = { "Name of Point" = {SECTOR_ID} }


//Map: Acerbus
[MAP01]
Points = {
    "Dummy Sector" = {1}
} // Points

Names = {
    "Dummy Sector" = {1}
} // Names
