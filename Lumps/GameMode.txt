//  Special thanks to Torr Samaho for not only making this special lump possible, but for helping me
//  set it up!



// This is a special instruction to tell the engine that we want to use
//  the Deathmatch spawn starts instead of the TeamGame [Blue|Red] starts.
//  This will provide workable spawn starts that is compatible with GZDoom
//  and Zandronum.
