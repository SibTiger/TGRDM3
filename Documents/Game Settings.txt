Game Settings
===================
Even though it is merely suggested, I have provided the default game settings as to how the players can win per-game.


FragLimit = 50
Give enough frags available for players to get into the game and competively.


TimeLimit = 5
To keep the game rolling and to avoid lengthy matches, enforce five minutes per-game.
