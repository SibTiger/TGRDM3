Description             : MAPS
                          -------------------------
                          This project contains eleven deathmatch maps based
                          on the New School genre that are inspired by Quake
                          3.  The maps presented in this project does require
                          GZDoom's OpenGL renderer, as the software renderer
                          does not yet have the capabilities to render
                          slopped 3D floors, as well as some visual
                          discrepancies.  In addition, I have also included three
                          legacy maps that used to be the main stock of the TGRDM3
                          project.  As the development of this project originally
                          started back in the year 2007, there has been a lot of
                          hit and misses, and these maps outline why and what I
                          have personally struggled on for many years.  Furthermore,
                          I have included four maps from my previous project, TGRDM2.
                          The ancient maps from that project have been slightly modified
                          to work with this project, along with its features.
                          
                          GAME MODES
                          -------------------------
                          With all of the maps aside, this project does contain some
                          useful features that players can enjoy.  For starters,
                          TGRDM3 works with Zandronum's extended game modes that
                          is not available in the GZDoom engine.  For example, this
                          project supports the following besides the usual Deathmatch
                          game mode: Team Deathmatch, Domination, Duel, Last Man Standing,
                          Team Last Man Standing, Possession, Team Possession, and Terminator.
                          Though, do note that with supporting Domination, some maps have varied
                          numbers of points.  Small maps might have one or two points, other
                          maps might contain up to four points.
                          
                          NOTABLE FEATURES
                          -------------------------
                          Moreover, there is some notable features included in this project.
                          This project will try to determine if the player is using OpenGL
                          and\or if that player is seeing Dynamic Lights.  If incase the
                          player is playing in Software Mode (VID_RENDERER 0) or if
                          Dynamic Lights (or point lights) is disabled, then this project
                          will try to brighting the maps for the player.  This will
                          make the maps slightly brighter instead of the usual darkness
                          that is luminated with Dynamic Lights.  However, as a draw back,
                          the maps will seem extremely flat-leveled in terms of lighting.
                          This, unfortunately, is a limitation of the implementation.
                          In addition, another notable feature, is the randomized music
                          player.  The music player will randomly shuffle the already
                          supplied music, and play the songs for an amount of time and
                          automatically change to the next song.  This feature alone
                          should provide a fresh experience when returning to the maps,
                          instead of getting the exact same experience each-time - - which
                          gets old quickly.  But of-course, this feature is automatically
                          disabled if music is turned off.
                          
                          PLAYABLE FEATURES
                          -------------------------
                          This project uses a lot of assets from various authors and
                          contributors, but here is a list of the most notable features
                          that stand out from the rest:
                          Marine Skins [Version 7: Minimal]
                            Displays what weapon the players are currently using or holding.
                            This feature, however, is only available for the Zandronum engine.

                          High Resolution Fonts
                            Displays high resolution font charactors that are much easier on the
                            eyes and clear to visually see on the screen.
                            >> http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?p=428998#p428998
                          High Definition Doom Sounds
                            This improves the audio of the weapons, some player sounds, and some
                            of the Doom environment sounds.

                          Smooth Weapons
                            This provides better and smoother animations to the weapons.
                            >> https://www.doomworld.com/vb/post/779518
                          SkullTag HiRes Pack for Items
                            Provides smoother and clearer sprites.  Visually, this gives some
                            sprites better blending of colours and smoothes out rough edges.
                            >> http://www.skulltag.com/download/
                          Voxels
                            This will provide a 3D like feel to the items and some objects within
                            the game.

                          Project Doom: Remix Music
                            This provides an upbeat feel to the original midi Doom music; this includes
                            most music from Doom, Doom 2, and TNT:Evilution.

                          Performance Notes:
                            This map might be rather resource and rendering
                            intensive on various systems abroad.  Here is a
                            few Console Variables that could help a bit by
                            disabling some special features based on the
                            GZDoom engine:
                                Line Mirrors (Software Renderer)
                                    R_DrawMirrors [True|False]
                                Line Mirrors (OpenGL Renderer)
                                    GL_Mirrors [True|False]
                                Sector Reflections
                                    GL_Plane_Reflection [True|False]
                                Dynamic Lights
                                    GL_Lights [True|False]
                                Render translucency effects
                                    R_DrawTrans [True|False]
                                Toggle Voxels
                                    R_DrawVoxels [True|False]
                                Toggle Rendering Precision
                                    GL_Render_Precise [True|False]

                            nightmare with managing over 600 3D Objects in
                            one map and having to deal with (G)ZDoom specific
