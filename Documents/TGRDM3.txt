Misc. Author Info       : Ich liebe Siberian Tigers :)

Description             : This project contains eleven deathmatch maps based
                          on the New School genre that are inspired by Quake
                          3.  The maps presented in this project does require
                          GZDoom's OpenGL renderer, as the software renderer
                          does not yet have the capabilities to render
                          slopped 3D floors, as well as some visual
                          discrepancies.
                          
                          
                          Performance Notes:
                            This map might be rather resource and rendering
                            intensive on various systems abroad.  Here is a
                            few Console Variables that could help a bit by
                            disabling some special features based on the
                            GZDoom engine:
                                    Line Mirrors --> R_DrawMirrors
                                    Sector Reflections --> GL_Plane_Reflection
                                    Dynamic Lights --> GL_Lights

                            nightmare with managing over 600 3D Objects in
                            one map and having to deal with (G)ZDoom specific
